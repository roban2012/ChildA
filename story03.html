现代音乐教育方法源自德语区的Dalcroze、Kodaly和Orff。Carl Orff（1895-1982）音乐风格冷峻、古朴、简洁，力主强调节奏的支配地位。Orff认为：表达（Expression）自己是人类的本能欲望。表达通过语言（文学数学）、音乐（含乐器演奏歌唱）、舞蹈及造型艺术等形式自然地发生。如同语言，这是人原本固有的能力。音乐教育的首要任务，就是不断地启发和提升这种本能的表现力，而表现得好不好则不是追求的最终目标。	<br><br>		
1、听力训练结合“人体乐器”和肢体语言（Flamenco舞蹈、口技、太极及疯狂英语），强化潜意识乐感。	<br><br>		
2、从朗诵入手，提取“节奏基石”，由诗而歌。	<br><br>		
3、节奏律动训练：拍手击鼓、敲击琴键、口哨竖笛，熟能生巧。	<br><br>		
4、演奏配合：组成打击乐器/Ukulele乐队，团队协作（编钟演奏/小星星/自由泳）。5、学生们参与即兴创作并演奏自己设计的音乐，但不用乐谱。日本Suzuki method，木（蔡美儿）方向错了。	<br><br>		
音乐教育：表达思想或感情；自尊自控；分享信任；传递激情；配合准确同步；坚持/熟能生巧；梦幻想象力。	<br><br>		
节奏（Rhythm）旋律（Melody）和声（Harmony）音色（Timbre）	<br><br>
