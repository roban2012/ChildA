This text is based on NAEA guidelines that recommend four components of art education: art production创作; aesthetics美学; art criticism批评; and art history历史. The book is divided into two parts: the first gives a strong theoretical base and the second provides art production methods and activities活动 for teaching art to children aged three to eight 3到8岁. 	<br><br>		
艺术教育内容：	<br><br>		
1、  创作	<br><br>		
2、  美学（理由）	<br><br>		
3、  批评（比较）	<br><br>		
4、  历史	<br><br>		
艺术的语言：	<br><br>		
1、  要素：色彩、线条、形状、结构、明度（value明暗深浅）、饱和度（鲜艳/纯）、空白	<br><br>		
2、  原理：安排组织意识要素的方法，如平衡、强调、比例、节奏（重复）、运动、变化、统一	<br><br>		
3、  艺术媒介、材料和工具	<br><br>		
4、  艺术的实现：技术方法	<br><br>		
5、  艺术家的风格	<br><br>		
6、  描述艺术的术语	<br><br>		
艺术批评的两个层次：	<br><br>		
1、  针对作品本身	<br><br>		
2、  研究相关领域	<br><br>		
HLS是Hue(色相)、Luminance(亮度/Value/明度)、Saturation(饱和度)。	<br><br>		
1、Hue(色相)是颜色的一种属性，是人为制定的几种色彩的基本颜色，例如Color Wheel。	<br><br>		
2、Value (亮度/ Luminance /明度)就是各种颜色的原色的明暗度，亮度调整也就是明暗度的调整。三原色的明暗度，从浅到深（白-灰-黑）。	<br><br>		
3、Saturation(饱和度/纯度)是指颜色的色彩与某人为规定的标准颜色（原色）相比较的近似程度，饱和度越高就越纯越鲜艳，就越接近标准颜色。	<br><br>

properties of color. Characteristics of colors: hue, value, intensity. 	<br><br>		
proportion. The size relationships of one part to the whole and of one part to another. 	<br><br>		
rectilinear. Formed or enclosed by straight lines to create a rectangle. 	<br><br>		
reflection. Personal and thoughtful consideration of an artwork, an aesthetic experience, or the creative process. 	<br><br>		
rhythm. Intentional, regular repetition of lines of shapes to achieve a specific repetitious effect or pattern. 	<br><br>		
rubric. A guide for judgment or scoring; a description of expectations. 	<br><br>		
scale. Relative size, proportion. Used to determine measurements or dimensions within a design or work of art. 	<br><br>		
sculpture. A three-dimensional work of art either in the round (to be viewed from all sides) or in bas relief (low relief in which figures protrude slightly from the background). 	<br><br>

shade. Color with black added to it. 	<br><br>		
shape. A two-dimensional area or plane that may be open or closed, free-form or geometric. It can be found in nature or is made by humans. 	<br><br>		
space. The emptiness or area between, around, above, below, or contained within objects. Shapes and forms are defined by the space around and within them, just as spaces are defined by the shapes and forms around and within them. 	<br><br>

structure. The way in which parts are arranged or put together to form a whole. 	<br><br>

subtractive. Refers to sculpting method produced by removing or taking away from the original material (the opposite of additive). 	<br><br>		
texture. The surface quality of materials, either actual (tactile) or implied (visual). It is one of the elements of art. 	<br><br>		
theme. An idea based on a particular subject. 	<br><br>		
three-dimensional. Having height, width, and depth. Also referred to as 3-D. 	<br><br>		
tint. Color lightened with white added to it. 	<br><br>		
tone. Color shaded or darkened with gray (black plus white). 	<br><br>		
two-dimensional. Having height and width but not depth. Also referred to as 2-D. 	<br><br>		
two-point perspective. A system to show three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional surface. The illusion of space and volume utilizes two vanishing points on the horizon line. 	<br><br>		
unity. Total visual effect in a composition achieved by the careful blending of the elements of art and the principles of design. 	<br><br>		
value. Lightness or darkness of a hue or neutral color. A value scale shows the range of values from black to white. 	<br><br>		
value scale. Scale showing the range of values from black to white and light to dark. 	<br><br>		
vanishing point. In perspective drawing, a point at which receding lines seem to converge. 	<br><br>		
variety. A principle of art concerned with combining one or more elements of art in different ways to create interest. 	<br><br>		
virtual. Refers to an image produced by the imagination and not existing in reality. 	<br><br>		
visual literacy. Includes thinking and communication. Visual thinking is the ability to transform thoughts and information into images; visual communication takes place when people are able to construct meaning from the visual image. 	<br><br>		
visual metaphor. Images in which characteristics of objects are likened to one another and represented as that other. They are closely related to concepts about symbolism. 	<br><br>
